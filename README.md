## 💫 About Me:
Chilean 🇨🇱 | Computer Science Enthusiast 🖥️ | Videogame enjoyer 🎮

I like learning new things, challenges and programming. I enjoy HEMA Longsword fencing, reading/watching sci-fi and fantasy and sometimes like to write stuff besides code.

**I'm currently working as Developer at [Entel](https://www.entel.cl/), so I may not be particularly active in here.**
